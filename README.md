# MY-TODO-APPLICATION
This Todo application helps users manage their tasks and stay organized. Users can add, edit, and delete tasks, mark tasks as completed, and prioritize them as needed.

This setup leverages Django on the backend for handling data storage, authentication, and API endpoints using Django REST framework. React.js on the frontend provides a dynamic and responsive user interface, with components like task lists, forms for adding/editing tasks, and buttons for task actions. Communication between the frontend and backend is achieved through RESTful API calls using JSON data format.
